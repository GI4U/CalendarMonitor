# CalendarMonitor

This is an application designed for the Raspberry Pi touchscreen to display upcoming events from your Google calendar. It informs you dynamically about any upcoming events and when you should depart to arrive in time at the event's location.

This is still a work in progress. Therefore, there may be still some errors in the code. New errors can be reported [here](https://github.com/GI4U/CalendarMonitor/issues/new).

Thank you for taking a look at this and have a nice day!
